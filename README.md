## Note
This project is the C++ implementation of tls-sig-api-v2. Previous asymmetric keys cannot use APIs of this version. To enable them to use APIs of this version, [see here](https://github.com/tencentcloud/tls-sig-api)。

## Download code and sync dependencies
```shell
git clone https://github.com/tencentcloud/tls-sig-api-v2-cpp.git
cd tls-sig-api-v2-cpp
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

If the above code sync fails, download the source code [here](https://github.com/tencentcloud/tls-sig-api-v2-cpp/releases).

## Build

### Unix-like system
`CMake` 、 `Make` and `GCC` are required for project building. Ensure that they have been installed.
```shell
cmake CMakeLists.txt
cmake --build .
```

If you need to manually specify the OpenSSL path, add the following commands when running the `cmake CMakeLists.txt`  command:
```shell
cmake  -DOPENSSL_ROOT_DIR=your_openssl_root_dir CMakeLists.txt
cmake --build .
```

The header file path is as follows:
```
src/tls_sig_api_v2.h
```

The library file path is as follows:
```

./libtlssigapi_v2.a
```

In addition to linking `libtlssigapi_v2.a`, you need to introduce `zlib`  and `openssl` when building a project. They usually come with Unix-like systems, and you only need to add the following command:
```
-lz -lcrypto
```

### Windows
Project building in Windows depends on `CMake` and `Visual Studio`. Ensure that they have been installed.

```
.\build.bat
```

The header file path is as follows:

```
src/tls_sig_api_v2.h
```

The library file paths are as follows (including Win32 and x64 as well as Debug and Release versions):
```
tls-sig-api_xx/xxxx/tlssigapi_v2.lib
tls-sig-api_xx/xxxx/zlibstatic.lib
tls-sig-api_xx/xxxx/mbedcrypto.lib
```
zlib of the Debug version is named zlibstaticd.lib.

When building a project, you only need to reference the header file `src/tls_sig_api_v2.h` and the three library files above.

## Usage

### API usage

```C
#include "tls_sig_api_v2.h"
#include <string>
#include <iostream>

std::string key = "5bd2850fff3ecb11d7c805251c51ee463a25727bddc2385f3fa8bfee1bb93b5e";

std::string sig;
std::sgring errmsg;
int ret = genUserSig(140000000, "xiaojun", key, 180*86400, sig, errmsg);
if (0 != ret) {
	std::cout << "genUserSig failed " << ret << " " << errmsg << std::endl;
} else {
	std::cout << "genUserSig " << sig << std::endl;
}

```

### Multi-thread support
Because Unix-like systems use OpenSSL by default, you need to call the following function during multi-thread program initialization. This issue does not exist in the Windows version.
```C
thread_setup();
```
Call the following function when the program ends:
```C
thread_cleanup();
```
